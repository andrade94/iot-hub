## 1. Business Rules (BR-xxx)

Every rule traces to workflows (WF-xxx), is enforced in specific code, and has a severity.

**Severity Key:** CRITICAL = system breaks if violated | HIGH = data integrity risk | MEDIUM = UX issue | LOW = preference

### 1.1 Operational Rules

## 6. Integration Map (INT-xxx)

| ID | Service | Purpose | Direction | Auth | Failure Mode | Timeout | Workflows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INT-001 | ChirpStack REST API | Device & gateway provisioning | Outbound | Bearer token (`Grpc-Metadata-Authorization`) | Log error, return false, update device status | 30s | WF-001 |
| INT-002 | ChirpStack MQTT | Sensor data ingestion, gateway status | Inbound | MQTT subscription | Log warning, skip malformed messages | — | WF-002 |
| INT-003 | Facturapi | CFDI invoice generation + PDF/XML download | Outbound | Bearer token | RuntimeException on create failure, null on download failure | 30s | WF-007 |
| INT-004 | SAP | Invoice export, journal entries, readings CSV | Outbound | `X-API-Key` + `X-Company-Code` headers | Store local JSON copy, log error, non-blocking | 30s | WF-010 |
| INT-005 | CONTPAQ | Invoice export, product catalog sync | Outbound | `X-API-Key` header | Store local JSON copy, log error, non-blocking | 30s | WF-010 |
| INT-006 | Twilio (WhatsApp) | Alert notifications via WhatsApp | Outbound + Webhook | Basic auth (SID + Token) | Log error, return false, graceful skip | 30s | WF-003 |
| INT-007 | Expo Push API | Mobile push notifications | Outbound | None (service-to-service) | Log error, auto-delete invalid tokens | 30s | WF-003, WF-005, WF-006 |
| INT-008 | Custom Webhooks | Event dispatch to subscriber URLs | Outbound | HMAC-SHA256 signature | Track failure count, auto-deactivate after 10 failures | 10s | WF-010 |

### Integration Criticality

| Integration | Criticality | Impact if Down |
|---|---|---|
| ChirpStack MQTT (INT-002) | **CRITICAL** | No sensor data ingestion — entire monitoring pipeline stops |
| ChirpStack REST (INT-001) | **HIGH** | Cannot provision new devices/gateways — onboarding blocked |
| Facturapi (INT-003) | **HIGH** | Cannot generate CFDI invoices — billing compliance blocked (Mexico) |
| Expo Push (INT-007) | **MEDIUM** | No mobile push notifications — email/WhatsApp fallback available |
| Twilio (INT-006) | **MEDIUM** | No WhatsApp alerts — push/email fallback available |
| SAP/CONTPAQ (INT-004/005) | **LOW** | Export delayed — local copies stored, non-blocking |
| Webhooks (INT-008) | **LOW** | External integrations delayed — auto-retry with failure tracking |

### Middleware: ApplyOrgBranding

> **Note (cross-ref WF-012 White-Label):** The `ApplyOrgBranding` middleware applies organization-specific CSS variables and branding (logo, colors, fonts) on every authenticated page load. It reads `current_organization.settings` and shares branding data via Inertia, enabling white-label customization per organization.
