## 1. Business Rules (BR-xxx)

Every rule traces to workflows (WF-xxx), is enforced in specific code, and has a severity.

**Severity Key:** CRITICAL = system breaks if violated | HIGH = data integrity risk | MEDIUM = UX issue | LOW = preference

### 1.1 Operational Rules

## 6. Integration Map (INT-xxx)

| ID | Service | Purpose | Direction | Auth | Failure Mode | Timeout | Workflows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INT-001 | ChirpStack REST API | Device & gateway provisioning | Outbound | Bearer token (`Grpc-Metadata-Authorization`) | Log error, return false, update device status | 30s | WF-001 |
| INT-002 | ChirpStack MQTT | Sensor data ingestion, gateway status | Inbound | MQTT subscription | Log warning, skip malformed messages | — | WF-002 |
| INT-003 | Facturapi | CFDI invoice generation + PDF/XML download | Outbound | Bearer token | RuntimeException on create failure, null on download failure | 30s | WF-007 |
| INT-004 | SAP | Invoice export, journal entries, readings CSV | Outbound | `X-API-Key` + `X-Company-Code` headers | Store local JSON copy, log error, non-blocking | 30s | WF-010 |

### Integration Criticality

| Integration | Criticality | Impact if Down |
|---|---|---|
| ChirpStack MQTT (INT-002) | **CRITICAL** | No sensor data ingestion — entire monitoring pipeline stops |
| ChirpStack REST (INT-001) | **HIGH** | Cannot provision new devices/gateways — onboarding blocked |
| Facturapi (INT-003) | **HIGH** | Cannot generate CFDI invoices — billing compliance blocked (Mexico) |
| Expo Push (INT-007) | **MEDIUM** | No mobile push notifications — email/WhatsApp fallback available |
| Twilio (INT-006) | **MEDIUM** | No WhatsApp alerts — push/email fallback available |
| SAP/CONTPAQ (INT-004/005) | **LOW** | Export delayed — local copies stored, non-blocking |
| Webhooks (INT-008) | **LOW** | External integrations delayed — auto-retry with failure tracking |

### Middleware: ApplyOrgBranding

> **Note (cross-ref WF-012 White-Label):** The `ApplyOrgBranding` middleware applies organization-specific CSS variables and branding (logo, colors, fonts) on every authenticated page load. It reads `current_organization.settings` and shares branding data via Inertia, enabling white-label customization per organization.

## 2. State Machines — Phase 10 (SM-011 → SM-014)

### SM-011: Corrective Action Lifecycle

  │ logged │──────────────────────────►│ verified  │
  └────────┘                           └──────────┘
```

| From | To | Trigger | Actor | Guard | Side Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| logged | verified | Verify action | site_manager, org_admin | Must be different user than taken_by (BR-057) | Sets verified_by, verified_at; included in compliance report |
| verified | — | TERMINAL | — | — | — |

**Notes:**
- Simple two-state lifecycle. Corrective actions cannot be deleted once logged (audit trail).
- Unverified actions appear with ⚠️ warning in compliance reports.

### SM-012: Data Export Lifecycle

```

```

| From | To | Trigger | Actor | Guard | Side Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| queued | processing | Job starts execution | System (`ExportOrganizationData` job) | — | — |
| processing | completed | All files generated, ZIP created | System | ZIP file exists on disk | NT-013 (Export Ready email with download link) |
| processing | failed | Exception during generation | System | — | Log error, notify requesting user |
| completed | expired | 48 hours after completion | System (scheduled cleanup) | `completed_at + 48h < now` | Delete ZIP file from storage |
| failed | queued | Manual retry | org_admin | Max 3 retries | Reset attempt counter |

### SM-013: Outage Declaration Lifecycle

```
  ┌──────────┐  end outage  ┌──────────┐
  │  active  │─────────────►│ resolved │
  └──────────┘              └──────────┘
```

| From | To | Trigger | Actor | Guard | Side Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | active | Declare outage | super_admin | `access command center` permission | NT-016 (banner to all orgs), suppress all offline alerts (BR-080) |
| active | resolved | End outage | super_admin | `access command center` permission | NT-017 (resume notification + missed alert summary), resume monitoring (BR-081) |
| resolved | — | TERMINAL | — | — | — |

**Notes:**
- Only one outage can be active at a time (enforced by unique constraint on `status='active'`).
- `declared_at`, `declared_by`, `resolved_at`, `resolved_by`, `reason` (text), `affected_services` (JSON).

### SM-004 Extension: Device `replaced` State
